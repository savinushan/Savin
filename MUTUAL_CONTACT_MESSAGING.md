# 🔐 Mutual Contact Messaging System

## 🎯 **Core Concept**

The Hey chat app now implements a **mutual contact verification system** where users can only message people who:

1. **Have your phone number** saved in their device contacts
2. **Are registered** on the Hey application  
3. **Have mutual contact relationship** (both have each other's numbers)

## 🛡️ **Privacy & Security Features**

### **✅ What This Enables**
- **Zero spam messaging** - impossible to receive unsolicited messages
- **Contact-based trust** - only people who know you can reach you
- **Mutual consent** - both parties must have each other's numbers
- **Real relationship verification** - ensures genuine connections

### **🚫 What This Prevents**
- **Random messaging** from unknown users
- **Spam and harassment** from strangers
- **Unwanted contact requests** from people you don't know
- **Privacy violations** through unsolicited communication

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Phone Verification**
- User registers with Sri Lankan phone number
- SMS OTP verification for security
- Phone number becomes unique identifier

### **Step 2: Contact Sync**
- App requests permission to access device contacts
- Securely reads contact list from device
- **Privacy**: Contacts never stored on servers

### **Step 3: Mutual Verification**
- Server checks which contacts are registered on Hey
- **Key Check**: Verifies if those contacts have YOUR number
- Only shows mutual contacts (bidirectional relationship)

### **Step 4: Secure Messaging**
- Messaging enabled only for mutual contacts
- Clear visual indicators for contact status
- Real-time online/offline status for mutual contacts

## 📱 **User Experience Flow**

### **🔐 Contact Verification Process**
\`\`\`
1. User A adds User B's number to contacts
2. User B adds User A's number to contacts  
3. Both users register on Hey
4. Both users sync contacts
5. ✅ Mutual messaging enabled
\`\`\`

### **⚠️ One-Way Contact Scenario**
\`\`\`
1. User A adds User B's number to contacts
2. User B does NOT add User A's number
3. Both users register on Hey
4. Both users sync contacts
5. ❌ Messaging blocked - not mutual
\`\`\`

## 🎨 **Visual Design Elements**

### **Contact Status Indicators**
- **🟢 Green Badge**: Mutual contact (can message)
- **🟠 Orange Badge**: One-way contact (can't message)
- **✅ UserCheck Icon**: Has your number
- **❌ UserX Icon**: Doesn't have your number
- **🔒 Lock Icon**: Messaging blocked
- **🔓 Unlock Icon**: Messaging enabled

### **Contact Categories**
1. **"Can Message"** - Mutual contacts with full messaging
2. **"Can't Message"** - One-way contacts with explanation
3. **Clear separation** with different colors and icons

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Contact Verification Service**
\`\`\`typescript
